# startup-files

General templates for various startup files. Includes:
- `.vimrc` for Vim
- `.bash_profile` for Mac OS X, also adaptable to `.bashrc` and `.cshrc`

This is intended to be for my own personal use, but others are welcome to use all or any part of these files. I am always open to any suggestions as well.
