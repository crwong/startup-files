# startup-files

General templates for various startup and configuration files. Includes:
- `.vimrc` for [Vim](http://www.vim.org/)
- `.bash_profile` for Mac OS X, also adaptable to `.bashrc` and `.cshrc`
- `Preferences.sublime-settings` for [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3)
- `Default (OSX).sublime-keymap` for [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3)
- `.gitconfig` for [Git](https://git-scm.com)

This is intended for my own personal use, but others are welcome to use these files as well. I am always open to any suggestions.
